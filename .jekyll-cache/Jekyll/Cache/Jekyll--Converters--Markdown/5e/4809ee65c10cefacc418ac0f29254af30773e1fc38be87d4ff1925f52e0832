<h3 id="alvaro-aguirre---november-2020">Alvaro Aguirre - November, 2020</h3>

<p>Thanks to lockdown, I recently got back into playing the guitar after a 8-year-long hiatus. When I was younger I was a rock/metal guy trying to play complicated solos on my V-shaped guitar, but those days are long gone. My interests have drifted towards blues, funk and jazz, which require a more comprehensive music theory understanding that I lacked. So, I decided to go back to the basics and learn and study. These genres use a wide variety of chords that as a rock player I had never seen, e.g. notable confusion when trying to play stuff like C#13b5b9. Best way to learn is constant exposure to new chords. I wanted to integrate that to my routine, every day get a new chord that I could explore, so, of course, I decided to write some code that would help me with that. In this blog post you will see the explanation of <a href="https://github.com/alvaroaguirre/Projects/blob/master/ChordOfTheDay/main.py" target="_blank">this code</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started---how-are-chords-constructed">Getting started - How are chords constructed?</h3>

<p>My goal was to randomly generate a chord every day, that would be sent to my email. The first step is obviously to determine how is a chord constructed. Let‚Äôs first go through some basics:</p>

<p>The <em>chromatic</em> scale is a sequence of 12 notes, each is one <em>semitone</em> higher than the previous one. For example, if we start with the note <em>A</em>, the next note is <em>A#</em> (A sharp), which is one semitone higher than <em>A</em>. Let‚Äôs create a list with the chromatic scale:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">chromatic</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"A"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"A#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"B"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"C"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"C#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"D"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"D#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"E"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"F"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"F#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"G"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"G#"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will notice that <em>B</em> and <em>E</em> do not have a sharp. These twelve are all the existing <em>individual notes</em>.</p>

<p>A chord is a collection of at least three individual notes. One of them is the <em>root</em> note, and the others are notes that are at a specific <em>distance</em> from the root. That distance is what determines the type of chord. And what does distance mean in this setting? <em>Distance</em> would mean the number of semitones between two notes. For example, between <em>C</em> and <em>E</em>, we have a distance of 4 semitones, or 2 full tones.</p>

<p>Before creating our first chord, we need to talk about the <em>major scale</em>. This is the most widely used scale and it is extremely important. You might have heard of <em>Do re mi fa sol la si</em>, or, in English notes: <em>C D E F G A B</em>. This is the <em>C</em> major scale. <em>C</em> because the first or <em>root</em> note is <em>C</em>, and <em>major scale</em> because of what notes follow, which are determined by the distance we discussed before. A major scale is constructed following the distances: 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. This means we start at the <em>root</em>, then move 2 semitones higher, and that‚Äôs our second note for the major scale, then move 2 more semitones, and that‚Äôs our third note, and so on.</p>

<p>For the C major scale, let‚Äôs look at the chromatic scale and put in bold the notes that are part of the major scale, which follow the 2-2-1-2-2-2-1:</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>, C#, <strong>D</strong>, D#, <strong>E</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, F#, <strong>G</strong>, G#, <strong>A</strong>, A#, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong></p>

<p>Nice, what about the major scale of <em>D#</em>? We can easily build it using the 2-2-1-2-2-2-1:</p>

<p><strong>D#</strong>, E, <strong>F</strong>, F#, <strong>G</strong>, <strong>G#</strong>, A, <strong>A#</strong>, B, <strong>C</strong>, C#, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>D#</strong></p>

<p>We can also give a number to each element of the major scale. We normally use roman numerals for this. For example, the III of the major scale of <em>C</em> is <em>E</em>, since it is the third element, starting from the root note. And <strong>this</strong> is what we will use to build chords, the elements of a note‚Äôs major scale. Let me give you a simple example. A major chord is build using the I-III-V, meaning the first, third, and fifth element of the major scale. So if we wanted to build the major chord of C, we would need <em>C</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>G</em>. If you play any instrument, you will realize that when you play a <em>C</em> chord, all the individual notes you are playing are one of those three. Different combinations create different chords, just to give you a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Major chord: I - III - V</li>
  <li>Minor chord: I - IIIb - V (b means flat)</li>
  <li>add9: I - III - V - IX</li>
  <li>9#11: I - III - V - VIIb - IX - XI# (# means sharp)</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, enough talking, let‚Äôs get to the code</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>Here we will put everything we have mentioned into code. Let‚Äôs define some functions that will be helpful.</p>

<p>First let‚Äôs create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scale(root)</code>. This function will take a note as the argument, which will be the <em>root</em> note, and return the <em>major scale</em> for that note:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">scale</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="c1"># Get the position of the root note in the chromatic scale above

    <span class="c1"># Use list comprehension to extract the notes

    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">major</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need to have in mind that we might encounter some sharps <em>#</em> and flats <em>b</em>, so we need to have a couple of functions that take care of that. These will return the sharped or flatted note:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sharp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chromatic</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="c1"># If its not the last element, return the following one

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">flat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="c1"># If its not the first element, return the previous one

        <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chromatic</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great. Now, before we continue, remember how I mentioned that a major chord is constructed using the first, third, and fifth note. Just like the major chord, there are many other variations. I have stored them all in a dictionary called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chords</code>. You can find it <a href="chords/chord_dictionary.py" target="_blank">here</a>. We have over 50 types of chords, and each one can be constructed using any of the 12 root notes. So we are talking about over 600 different chords! Each entry of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chords</code> dictionary contains as key the name of the chord, and as value a list with the positions of the chord. For example:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Sample element of the chords dictionary
</span><span class="n">chords</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="s">"7#5"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"#5"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"b7"</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will note the flats and sharps are strings in order to include the <em>#</em> and <em>b</em> that will tell us which notes to find. Now we need to construct a function that takes as arguments the <em>root</em> note of the chord, and the list of <em>positions</em>, e.g. [1, 3, ‚Äú#5‚Äù, ‚Äúb7‚Äù], and outputs the notes in the major scale of the <em>root</em> note on those positions.</p>

<p>We are all ready! Now we only have to select a random element from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chord</code> dictionary, a random <em>root</em> note, and use our functions to find which individual notes compose that particular chord. For this, let‚Äôs create a function that performs the randomization and outputs a n-tuple:</p>
